                <h2>TeamSDA Music</h2>
                <p>This website is my first original project, and still is my first love. I play the guitar, and a while
                    back I developed some lessons to teach some of my friends to play guitar - this website takes these
                    lessons and makes them available online for everyone to learn!</p>

                <h2>MCFantasy</h2>
                <p>I created this website for a friend of mine who loves the write fanction, and has recently started
                    writing her own books as well. She needed a place to publish and share her work, and since I liked
                    her work so much, I decided to put it online for everyone else to read!</p>

                        </h3>
                        <p>I didn't grow up thinking i'd be a software engineer 👨🏾‍💻 one day. I always thought i'd be
                            a doctor 👨🏾‍⚕️ of some kind - had the grades for it too and all 🤓. It was in my second
                            year of pre-med that the pandemic 😷 struck, and in the existential crisis that followed I
                            shifted gears and chose the path that I'm on now, and I've never looked back.</p>
                        <p>Now as a business owner and trading consultant with Protracon, I trade stocks 📈 and futures
                            📉, and study software engineering via FreeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, YouTube, and any
                            other free resource I can get my hands on. It's quite amazing how much you can learn for
                            free on the internet these days 🌐.</p>
                        <p>Things I like to do in my free time include playing the guitar 🎸 and piano 🎹, reading books
                            📖 about Finance, English Lit, History, Science/Technology, and enjoying the beautiful
                            outdoors 🌳. And when I'm not doing those things, i'm blogging about my progress as a
                            developer 👨🏾‍💻. </p>
